# HFD-Incident-Pull
The goal of this is to attempt to resolve the issue of [this project](https://github.com/d-m-wilson/HoustonIncidents), see [this issue](https://github.com/d-m-wilson/HoustonIncidents/issues/1) for more details on why the original project is broken.

The developer of the original project was forced to put up this plea on his [website](https://dmwilson.info/), and it was a tool that I used almost daily, so my goal is to attempt to find another way to get the incident data to his site.

I will attempt to use [this feed](https://www.broadcastify.com/webPlayer/28416) to get incident type and location then format it in a way that works with the site, so it is able to use the information.
